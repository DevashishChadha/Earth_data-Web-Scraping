Common Metadata Repository (CMR) APIs,CMR is a spatial and temporal metadata registry that stores metadata from a variety of science disciplines and domains. CMR is intended to enable broader use of NASA's EOS data by providing a more uniform view of NASA’s substantial and diverse data holdings. CMR interfaces with clients and users through various APIs; CMR is an open system.,/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/cmr-api
Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) APIs,"NASA's Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), located throughout the United States, are custodians of EOS mission data and ensure that data will be easily accessible to users. A number of APIs are available for direct access to these data holdings.",/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/daac-apis
Earthdata Login APIs,"Earthdata Login provides user profile management and authentication services, freeing up your application from the problems associated with managing user databases. Earthdata Login also provides an application programming interface (API) that can be used to query the user database and retrieve user information.",/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/earthdata-login-api
Earthdata Search APIs,"Earthdata Search is a modern, highly visible web application that helps you search, discover, visualize, refine, and access Earth observation data made available by NASA and other interagency and international partners.",/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/earthdata-search-api
Earthdata Tools APIs,NASA's Earthdata system provides a number of tools and services geared towards supporting the global Earth Science community. These services are available for use by developers of Earth science data systems and applications.,/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/earthdata-tools-api
Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) APIs,"The Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) are designed to deliver global, full-resolution satellite imagery to users in a highly responsive manner, enabling interactive exploration of the Earth.",/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/gibs-api
Science Data Processing Software (SDPS) APIs,"Programmatic Access is a capability enhancement to the Data Access services at EOSDIS Service Interface (ESI)-enabled DAACs. The ESI-enabled DAACs are the National Snow and Ice Data Center DAAC (NSIDC DAAC), Land Processes DAAC (LP DAAC), and Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC). It adds an ability for the ESI Gateway Interface (EGI) to access CMR, and extends the accessible protocols to include Web Coverage Service (WCS) compatibility.",/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/sdps-api
OPeNDAP APIs,"OPeNDAP is the developer of client/server software, of the same name, that enables scientists to share data more easily over the internet. The OPeNDAP group is also the original developer of the Data Access Protocol (DAP) that the software uses. Many other groups have adopted DAP and provide compatible clients, servers, and SDKs. OPeNDAP’s DAP is also a NASA community standard. Learn more on the official OPeNDAP website.",/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/opendap
Hyrax Data Server Installation and Configuration Guide,"The Hyrax Data Server Installation and Configuration Guide describes the features and operation of the Hyrax data server, a data server developed by OPeNDAP, Inc. as a reference server for the Data Access Protocol, versions 2 (DAP2) and 4 (DAP4). The Hyrax server is a modular software with a number of handlers that are loaded into a core framework based on the contents of configuration files. Each of the server’s modules provides a distinct functional capability, such as reading data from a certain kind of file, encoding data, or processing data in different ways.",https://opendap.github.io/hyrax_guide/Master_Hyrax_Guide.html
NASA APIs,"NASA APIs is part of NASA's Office of the Chief Information Officer, nestled in the Technology, Data, and Innovation Division. The objective of NASA APIs is to make NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to application developers. The NASA APIs catalog is online and growing.",https://api.nasa.gov/
